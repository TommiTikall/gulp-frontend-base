                    Lofoten's cliff befested islands, surrounded by sea, has a nature that is so unique, pure and full of vitality.
                    The pure nature and its waters is what Lofotpils is all about. We aim to create a beer that represents the best of Lofoten, by adding the clean waters of Lofoten and other fresh ingredients in our beer.
                    <br>
                    Hence our motto: TASTE OF PURE NATURE
                    <br><br>
                    Lofoten consists of many small islands, and has a harsh environment, being so exposed to the sea and wind.
                    <br>
                    Taste of pure nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lofotpils uses Lofoten as inspiration for all beers brewed.
