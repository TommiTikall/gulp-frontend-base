# Gulp Frontend Base

This repo is a fork of Joe Richardson's [gulp-starter](https://github.com/dope/gulp-starter), which I have built upon to create something that works for me and the way I like to work with frontend develpment. Big ups to Joe for his inital setup, which got me started on this.

`$ npm install/update` to install node package dependencies

`$ bower install/update` to install bower package dependencies

`$ gulp` to init project and localhost


### Features 

- NPM: For gulp and backend
- Bower
- Gulp
- [Jeet.gs grid](http://jeet.gs)
- Blocks templating
- Many best practices I have developed over my years as a frontend developer
